  // Define the six input variables

  // Define the two computed variables

  /* 2. Read in the user's first and middle name */
  // example: Enter your first and middle names: Johnathan Student

  /* 3. Read in the user's age */
  // example: Enter your age: 31

  /* Read in the user's street number, name, and type */
  // example: Enter your street number, name, and type: 222 Johnson Lane

  /* 4. Computer the user's actor age */
  // The actor's new age will be the remainder after dividing the street number
  // by their age. That quantity is then multiplied by 3.

  /* 5. Computer the user's actor street number */
  // The actor's new numeric address will be the actor's current age multiplied
  // by 357, then divided by their current street number.

  /* 6. Print out the user's actor name */
  // The actor's new first name will be their current street name. The actor's
  // new last name will be their current middle name.
  // example: Your movie star name is Johnson Student.

  /* 7. Print out the user's computed actor age */
  // example: You will play a 15 year old.

  /* 8. Print out the user's actor address with the computed street number */
  // The actor's new street name will be their current first name. The
  // street type will remain unchanged.
  // example: Your address is 49 Johnathan Lane.
